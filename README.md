# TreeFund

## Background

TreeFund emerged in response to the escalating deforestation and pollution crises in Mexico. With a deep commitment to environmental conservation, TreeFund aims to safeguard our planet's future by preserving natural resources and fostering a sustainable environment.

## Mission

TreeFund is dedicated to combating deforestation and pollution across Mexico. Our mission encompasses:

- **Sustainable Reforestation Initiatives:** Implementing projects that not only plant trees but also ensure their survival and growth, contributing to the restoration of natural habitats.
- **Environmental Education:** Raising awareness about the importance of environmental conservation through educational programs and community outreach.
- **Advocacy for Environmental Policies:** Lobbying for the enactment and enforcement of stronger environmental policies to protect natural resources and reduce pollution.

## Development

The development of TreeFund's platform leveraged modern and robust technologies to create a scalable and efficient system. The technology stack includes:

- **Node.js:** Utilized for building the backend infrastructure, providing a scalable and efficient server-side solution.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, used to build our API endpoints and manage server-side logic.
- **React:** Employed for the frontend development, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **CSS:** Used to style the frontend, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database, chosen for its flexibility and scalability, handling our data storage and retrieval needs.

## Connection with Stripe

Integrating Stripe as our payment gateway was a critical component of our platform, enabling us to process donations securely and efficiently. This integration posed significant challenges, requiring:

- **Extensive Testing:** Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure the security and reliability of the payment process.
